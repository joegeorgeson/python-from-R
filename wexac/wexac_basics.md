# A quick guide to using wexac HPC/LSF

As a schwartzlab member, we have our own private queue that doesn't have preemption. We also have access to the 'molgen' departmental queues which do have preemption, but only for other users in the department and based on priority. There is an additional molgen-gpu queue that is smaller than the general gpu queues, but has no time limit and is basically never used. The main limitation is that jobs are limited to 1gpu (as opposed to 5 on the main queues).
